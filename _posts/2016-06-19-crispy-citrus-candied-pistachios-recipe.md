  This recipe takes advantage of our Fresh Lemon Syrup, which doesn't contain
  any added water or juice, helping the pistachios toast up extra crisp and
  crunchy. The syrup's subtle acidity brightens the darker notes of the roasted
  nuts and caramelized sugar, keeping the overall flavor fresh and light,
  perfect for sprinkling over spring salads and fruity desserts, or just
  snacking out of hand.

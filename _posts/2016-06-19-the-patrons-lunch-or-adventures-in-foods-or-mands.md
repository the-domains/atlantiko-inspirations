  A British affair As Partners of The Patron's Lunch, we've worked with our
  product development experts to craft bespoke products that showcase fantastic
  ingredients from around the British Isles for this wonderful event. As ever,

  with for decades, to create an incredible picnic hamper for our guests on The
  Mall.
